# drone-build-button

Have problems with Github hooks to Drone? This might help!

## Usage

Install it (TODO how), configure it (TODO how) and visit a **COMMIT PAGE** e.g.

`https://github.com/Codesleuth/drone-build-button/commit/a9fd3aeee590f1774cce6330f0aaad113f531a28`

Click the addon icon and click `Build`. Currently it gives as much feedback as a NES controller, sorry.
